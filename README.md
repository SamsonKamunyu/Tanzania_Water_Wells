## Authors: Medrine Waeni, Felix Nyagah, Samson Kamunyu, Brian Magembe, Wendy Mwiti
## Project goal
The government of Tanzania to adopt the model developed in order to improve on the general  maintenance operations on the water points to ultimately meet the water needs of its citizens.

## Column names
1.	date_recorded	- The date the row was entered

2. funder	- Who funded the well

3.	gps_height -	Altitude of the well

4.	installer -	Organization that installed the well

5.	longitude -	GPS coordinate

6.	latitude -	GPS coordinate

7.	wpt_name -	Name of the waterpoint if there is one

8.	num_private -	Number of private waterpoints

9.	basin -	Geographic water basin

10. subvillage -	Geographic location

11.	region -	Geographic location

12.	region_code -	Geographic location

13.	district_code -	Geographic loc

14.	lga -	Geographic location

15.	ward -	Geographic location

16.	population -	Population around the well

17.	public_meeting -	True/False

18.	recorded_by -	Group entering this row of data

19.	scheme_management -	Who operates the waterpoint

20.	scheme_name -	Who operates the waterpoint

21.	permit -	If the waterpoint is permitted

22.	construction_year -	Year the waterpoint was constructed

23.	extraction_type -	The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses

24.	extraction_type_group -	The kind of extraction the waterpoint uses

25 . status_group -	Condition of the well

## Findings 
The Random Forest algorithm, having the highest precision score of all performed better than the other models and shall be used as the final model 
The precision score of the model was 66% which means that it was able to precisely determine the status of the waterpoint 66% of the time

## Recommendations
- The government should prioritize drawing water from springs when building the waterpoints and should not draw water sourced from shallow wells or boreholes as they spoil the pumps quicker

- Water points with enough water should be closely monitored, as the high use could lead to their failure.
